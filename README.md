# Elevating-fingerprint-matching
This project proposes combining cutting-edge algorithms such as dHash, SIFT-Harris  feature points, and Locality-Sensitive hashes to create an efficient fingerprint-matching system. It aims to improve  matching accuracy, data breach avoidance, robustness, and processing speed in fingerprint recognition systems.
